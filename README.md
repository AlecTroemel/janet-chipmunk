# janet-chipmunk

[Janet](https://janet-lang.org) bindings to [Chipmunk2D](https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D). The bindings are faithful to the original C API, especially where it makes sense, but function names have been "lispified" (kebab case, question marks instead of the word "Is", etc.).

Take a look at the examples for... examples! Note that they all require Jaylib.
